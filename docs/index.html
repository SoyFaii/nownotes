                NowNotes is a simple app made as a <i>usable</i> replacement for the Windows Notepad.<br>
                Windows Notepad is ok to take notes quickly, just type 'Notepad' on the Windows Search and start typing on it. It's simple and only uses a few resources.<br>
                But it's as simple as impractical.<br>
                NowNotes is a simple app made specially for that, trying to immitate something similar to the 'Quick Notes' function of iPadOS and macOS.<br>
                <h3>Simple, but clearer texts.</h3>
                <p>It's simple to use, just click on the anytime available icon at the system tray and start typing. With NowNotes, notes are more intuitive. It allows you to do simple formating; <strong>bold</strong>, <em>italic</em> or <u>underlined</u> text are available, as well as titles.</p>
                <h3>Your desktop. Panic-less.</h3>
                <p>Your desktop will never be a disaster again. The notes are saved <em>automatically</em> right on NowNotes, and aren't on any common folder, so don't mind. Talking about desktop: when NowNotes is open, it's all time on the top of it, so you don't have to reopen and reopen the app every time it dissapears.</p>
